	In order to understand <em>where</em> "The Onceuh Experience" is going, I want you understand <em>what</em> it is.
<p>
</header>
<em><strong>ART</em></strong>
<br>
Noun: the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power.
<h2><P>
<br>
⛧ ⛧ ⛧
<br>
<br>
It's quite simple honestly, everybody has a different definition of art, for me, art is anything that can be produced visually from the creative mind. 
<br></P>

Although I doubt many people would consider "edits" or "AMVs" a form of art, to me, thats art itself. 
<br>
Before people get the wrong idea, I don't devalue Artists and Painters, bless them for their works of art. 
<br>
"The Onceuh Experience" isn't to change the way people see art. It to recognize and appreciate another form of art. 
<br>
<br>
My form of art.</h2>

This is "PHASE 0.1", reaching perfection. For perfection will see the world, beyond "PHASE 6.0"
